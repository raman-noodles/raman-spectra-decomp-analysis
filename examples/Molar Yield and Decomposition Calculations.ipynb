    "Once components in a mixture Raman spectra have been identified and assigned, and psudo-Voigt curve fiting has been completed the next step is to compare pure component calibration (or non-decomposing, non-reacting) area under peaks to experimental data. From this comparision one will be able to deterimine:\n",
